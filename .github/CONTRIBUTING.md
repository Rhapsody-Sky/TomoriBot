# Contributing to TomoriBot

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers what you need to know before opening a PR.

## Branching

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Default branch, fork from here, target PRs **here** |
| `release` | Deploy gate, stable versions that reflect the public deployed TomoriBot.|
| `dev` | Maintainer's personal (unstable) development branch. |

## Quality Gates

The project has no strict coding standards other than what the automated tools enforce, but reading the official [Contributing](https://docs.tomoribot.app/contributing/) and [Architecture](https://docs.tomoribot.app/architecture/) docs can help you understand and follow established code conventions in the project.

Please refer to the [Pull Request Template](./pull_request_template.md) for the exact list of local checks you should run before submitting a PR. CI handles these automatically, but running them locally and fixing any problems saves time. If your PR is too big (around ~1000 lines of changes/additions), please split it up into multiple, smaller PRs instead if possible so it is easier to discuss and test.

### AI-Generated Code
This project accepts code and documentation created/assisted by AI tools. But just like all tools, the one using it (you) is responsible for it. It is also preferred to point your agent to `docs\architecture` and `docs\contributing` so it can follow conventions and security measures established around the codebase. Please test and review thoroughly before opening a PR, and be ready to discuss and fix problems that the maintainer(s) find, if any.

## Scope of Contributions

Welcome without prior discussion:

- Bug fixes with a clear repro
- Locale corrections or new translations
- New built-in tools or LLM providers that follow the existing adapter pattern
- New top-level slash commands
- Performance improvements (no behavior change)

Please open an issue first to discuss:

- Architecture or schema changes
- Changes to caching, security, or persona-identity behavior
- New external integrations (Matrix, SillyTavern-style imports, etc.)
