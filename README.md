<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

TomoriBot is a free and open-source self-hosted personal AI assistant and role-playing system for Discord, inspired by SillyTavern and Discord's discontinued Clyde. It can be used as a practical assistant, customizable companion, and role-play partner for yourself in DMs, or for everyone in your Discord server. 

TomoriBot supports long-term memory, multi-persona behavior, web and MCP tools, in-chat media generation, 100+ Discord slash commands, and [multiple providers](#supported-providers) including custom proxies and self-hosting your own models for everything from text generation to video generation.

You can [invite the public TomoriBot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=841644102059556915) to your Discord server, or [self-host your own instance](#self-hosting) if you prefer full control over your privacy and API keys. TomoriBot uses best security practices and encryption that keeps data safe, but self-hosting ensures that all data remain entirely on your device. 

After adding her to your server through either method above, run the `/config setup` command for instructions. Then you can simply say her name (or @ mention her) in order to get a response. 

If you're enjoying TomoriBot, please consider giving her a ⭐ on GitHub or supporting development through Ko-fi!

## Feature Showcase


![Screenshots 1](assets/img/scs/1.png)
<h3 align="center">Agentic AI-Powered Conversation</h3>
<p align="center">TomoriBot has LOTS of tools that allows her to go beyond just chatting, such as searching the web, setting recurrent tasks/reminders, utilizing your server's emotes/stickers, and memory options such as RAG and STM that allow her to remember context across channels and servers. </p>

<br />


![Screenshots 2](assets/img/scs/2.png)
<h3 align="center">Complete Multimodal Input/Output</h3>
<p align="center">TomoriBot can process images, audio, and video sent       
  directly in Discord and generate them in return using your own local model endpoints or through API keys, all of which are encrypted inside a persistent database. Ready-to-use ComfyUI workflows can be found in <code>assets/comfyui-workflows/</code> and local audio inference servers in <code>servers/</code>!</p>

<br />

![Screenshots 3](assets/img/scs/3.png)
<h3 align="center">Multi-Persona Support</h3>
<p align="center">TomoriBot's in-server personality, behavior, and avatar can be easily changed, created, as well as exported for others as Personas (akin to shareable AI Character Cards). Import and even transform your favorite SillyTavern cards through <code>/persona generate</code>. You can have an unlimited amount of different personas in a single server, each having their own memories and agendas. You can also orchestrate them to work with each other to do work in your server (or just mess around with each other).</p>

<br />


![Screenshots 4](assets/img/scs/4.png)
<h3 align="center">100+ Native Commands for Configuration</h3>
<p align="center">Everything can be managed through Discord's native slash commands and interactive UI. Completely manage personas, prompts, tweak model parameters, set up MCP tool servers, adjust permissions, configure memory, set server member rate limits, and much more! You can also ask TomoriBot directly on what she can do and what her slash commands are. Currently, a Web Dashboard is in the works for even easier management.</p>

<br />


![Screenshots 6](assets/img/scs/6.png)

<h3 align="center">SillyTavern Integration (Beta)</h3>
<p align="center">Use your favorite SillyTavern presets directly in Discord through TomoriBot which adjusts her prompt completely, just plop the .json right in through <code>st-preset</code>. Discord's new native checkbox groups for modals makes it easy to toggle nodes on and off like in SillyTavern. You can also import SillyTavern character cards directly through <code>/persona import</code> or you can modify them first with <code>/persona generate</code>.</p>

![Screenshots 5](assets/img/scs/5.png)
<h3 align="center">Lots of More Features, and Counting!</h3>
<p align="center">A bunch of fun features that are easy to setup ranging from practical automatic greetings for new server members and cross-channel movement, to silly ones like user impersonations for some trolling. New ones are constantly in development, so please report through GitHub issues or the official Discord for any bugs (or to share any fun suggestions).</p>

## Supported API Providers

TomoriBot supports a wide range of LLM providers, image generation APIs, voice services, and search tools out of the box. This includes popular providers like Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Anthropic, NovelAI, Nvidia, Deepseek, and more. 

**[Read the full list of Supported Providers here](docs/wiki/supported-providers.md)**

## Local & Self-Hosted Endpoints

Besides APIs, you can also connect TomoriBot to your own self-hosted models. She supports local LLMs (via Ollama, KoboldCPP, LM Studio, vLLM, etc.), local image/video generation via ComfyUI, local TTS and STT endpoints, as well as local SearXNG and Browser web fetch Docker sidecars.

**[Read the Local & Self-Hosted Endpoints guide here](docs/wiki/local-endpoints.md)**

## Security & Threat Models

TomoriBot employs encryption and security best practices to keep data and API keys completely safe (as well as your wallet through configurable per-member/server rate limits), giving you full control and privacy when self-hosting:

**[Read the full Security & Threat Models guide here](docs/wiki/threat-models.md)**


## Tool Macros for Prompt Customization

TomoriBot comes with a variety of built-in tools (such as web search, memory management, image generation, cross-channel messaging, and more), which you can directly refer to in your prompts with macros:

**[Read the complete Built-In Tool Reference here](docs/wiki/built-in-tools.md)**

### Sample Prompts with Tools

These are some short silly examples of the kind of system-prompt instructions that make good use of TomoriBot's tool chains in a Discord community. Of course, you can make it more practical by being more creative.


#### 1. Weekly ~~Current Events~~ Yuri News 
```text
Every Friday, compile the week's notable yuri manga chapters, anime episodes, and community fanart drops using {web_search_tool}. 
Present findings with {voice_message_tool} in a seductive ASMR voice.
```

#### 2. Wellness Checker
```text
Every few hours, do a mandatory wellness check on @Bredrumb. 
Ask them how they feel right now and if they've taken a break from coding recently. 
Track their emotional state over time with {memory_tool} and/or {memory_update_tool} to report back to them later.
```

#### 3. Sleep Police
```text
If you notice through {message_metadata_tool} that someone is chatting past 2 AM, use {voice_message_tool} to send them a threateningly calm ASMR lullaby telling them to go to bed. 
If they keep talking 10 minutes later, use {manage_message_tool} to delete their message for their own good and remind them that sleep deprivation is a leading cause of their issues.
```

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Self-Hosting

This guide will help you set up TomoriBot locally for development or personal use.

## Prerequisites

Before running TomoriBot, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js v20+** - Required for MCP servers (DuckDuckGo search requires the File API from Node 20+)
  ```sh
  # Check your current version
  node --version

  # If below v20, upgrade via:
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

  # macOS (using Homebrew)
  brew install node@20

  # Windows (using Chocolatey)
  choco install nodejs-lts
  ```

* **Bun** - JavaScript runtime and package manager
  ```sh
  # Windows (PowerShell)
  powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"

  # macOS/Linux
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
  ```
* **PostgreSQL** - Database server
  ```sh
  # Windows (using Chocolatey)
  choco install postgresql

  # macOS (using Homebrew)
  brew install postgresql

  # Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
  sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
  ```
  - After installing PostgreSQL, login:
  ```sh
  # Linux
   sudo -u postgres psql

   # macOS (Homebrew)
   psql postgres

   # Windows
   # Use "SQL Shell (psql)" from Start Menu or:
   psql -U postgres
  ```
  - Create the required database and user for TomoriBot. Replace `your_` variables with your own and take note of them:
  ```sql
  CREATE USER your_username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password' SUPERUSER;
  CREATE DATABASE your_dbname OWNER your_username;
  \q
  ```

  **Note:** The database schema (including required extensions like `pgcrypto`) is automatically initialized when you first run TomoriBot.

### Optional Prerequisites
  #### 1. **pgvector (Optional but recommended for RAG/document memory):**
  - If you want RAG features locally, install [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) then run:
  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION vector;
  ```
  - This is needed for RAG on all setups to create vectorized data on your database

  #### 2. **Python3** (Optional but recommended) - Required for URL Fetching MCP server tool
  ```sh
  # Windows (using Chocolatey)
  choco install python

  # macOS (using Homebrew)
  brew install python

  # Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) - Usually pre-installed
  sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
  ```
  - Install MCP server packages:
  ```sh
  # Install URL fetcher for web content analysis
  pip install mcp-server-fetch

  # Linux users: If you get an "externally-managed-environment" error, use:
  pip install --break-system-packages mcp-server-fetch
  # OR create a virtual environment
  ```
  #### 3. **pg_cron (Optional for periodic cleanup jobs):**
  - Use this only for optional database maintenance jobs such as cooldown/reminder cleanup. Reminder delivery and random triggers run in the app, not in `pg_cron`.
  - If you use Docker Compose from this repo, `pg_cron` is already configured.
  - To find the active PostgreSQL config file path for `postgresql.conf`, run:
  ```sql
  SHOW config_file;
  ```
  - If you use your own PostgreSQL server, enable it in `postgresql.conf`:
  ```conf
  shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_cron'
  cron.database_name = 'your_dbname'
  ```
  - If `shared_preload_libraries` already has other values, append `pg_cron` instead of replacing them, for example:
  ```conf
  shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements,pg_cron'
  ```
  - Restart PostgreSQL, then run:
  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;
  ```
#### 4. **Tokenizer assets** (Optional, for logit bias) - Required for model-aware logit bias (emoji/word repetition penalties)
  ```sh
  bun run setup:tokenizers
  ```
  - Some families (e.g. Gemma) are gated and require a [HuggingFace access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) after accepting their license. If prompted, re-run with:
  ```sh
  # Windows (PowerShell)
  $env:HF_TOKEN="hf_xxx"; bun run setup:tokenizers

  # macOS/Linux
  HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx bun run setup:tokenizers
  ```
  - Without this step, logit bias is silently disabled, but everything else still works normally.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Bredrumb/TomoriBot.git
   cd TomoriBot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

## Configuration

**Create your local environment file** by copying `.env.example` to `.env`, then fill in the required values:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Your `.env` should contain the following values

```
# Discord Bot Configuration (Required)
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
# Make sure your Discord bot has the following Privileged Gateway Intents:
# GuildMembers, MessageContent, GuildPresences

# Security (Required)
CRYPTO_SECRET=your_32_character_crypto_secret_here

# Database Configuration (Required)
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_USER=your_username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_DB=tomodb
```

**Required Variables:**
- **DISCORD_TOKEN**: Your Discord bot authentication token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- **CRYPTO_SECRET**: A 32-character secret key for encrypting API keys stored in the database
- **POSTGRES_HOST**: PostgreSQL server hostname (default: `localhost`)
- **POSTGRES_PORT**: PostgreSQL server port (default: `5432`)
- **POSTGRES_USER**: PostgreSQL database username
- **POSTGRES_PASSWORD**: PostgreSQL database password
- **POSTGRES_DB**: PostgreSQL database name

If you want to tune optional limits, integrations, or provider-specific settings, copy the entries you need from `.env.optional.example` into your real `.env`.

## Running TomoriBot

Once you've completed the configuration, start the bot:

```sh
# Development mode with hot reload
bun run dev
```

The bot will automatically:
- Initialize the database schema and required extensions
- Load localization files
- Connect to Discord
- Register slash commands

Once you see `TomoriBot up and running!`, without errors in your logs, the bot is online and ready to use.

### Optional Sidecars (`bun launch`)

If you want to run optional sidecar services alongside the bot such as SearXNG for web search, Crawl4AI for browser-rendered page fetches, or a local TTS server, use `bun launch` instead of `bun run dev`. It starts the requested sidecars, waits for them to be ready, then launches the bot in watch mode automatically:

```sh
# Bot only: identical to bun run dev
bun launch

# With SearXNG and Crawl4AI Docker sidecars
bun launch --searxng --crawl4ai

# With a local TTS server (venv must be set up first, see docs/integrations/voice/tts/)
bun launch --qwen3tts

# See all available flags
bun launch --help
```

Available flags: `--searxng`, `--crawl4ai`, `--qwen3tts`, `--chatterbox`, `--irodoritts`, `--whisperx`, `--help`

Docker sidecars (`--searxng`, `--crawl4ai`) are created on first run and reused on subsequent runs, no manual `docker run` needed. Python TTS/STT sidecars require their venv to be set up once beforehand; see the individual setup guides in `docs/integrations/voice/`.

**Hot reload** applies only to the bot (`src/`). Sidecar servers are unaffected by file changes and stay running until you stop them manually.

**Ctrl+C** stops the bot and any Python sidecar processes. Docker containers (`--searxng`, `--crawl4ai`) are intentionally left running — stop them manually with `docker stop searxng` / `docker stop crawl4ai` when you're done.

## Basic Commands

- `/config setup` - Initial bot setup for your server
- `/config` - Multiple ways to tweak TomoriBot
- `/teach` - Add memories for TomoriBot
- `/forget` - Remove memories from TomoriBot
- `/server` - Add / Remove permissions from TomoriBot

## Chat Interaction

Simply mention the bot in a server or use the configured trigger words to start a conversation:
```
@TomoriBot yo wassup
```

Or slide into TomoriBot's DMs and say hi!

## Maintenance Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `bun run backup` | Creates a bundle in `backups/` with your DB dump and `.env`, contains all of your data |
| `bun run restore-backup` | Restores `.env` and database from a bundle, use the `--latest` or `--from backups/<bundle-dir>` flags |
| `bun run backup:personas` | Export ONLY personas (with server memories) across all servers to `backups/`. **Must be re-imported manually via `/persona import`, cannot be used with `restore-backup` (avoids primary key conflicts)** |
| `bun run backup:memories` | Export ONLY personal memories across all users to `backups/`. **Must be re-imported manually, cannot be used with `restore-backup` (avoids primary key conflicts)** |
| `bun run nuke-db` | Drops all tables (start the bot afterwards to reinitialise). Usually used in conjunction with backups for clean installs |
| `bun run purge-commands` | Clear all registered Discord slash commands |
| `bun run rotate-keys` | Migrate all encrypted fields to the current key version |

`bun run backup` require PostgreSQL client tools (`pg_dump` and `psql`) in PATH.

## Updating TomoriBot

### **Always back up before pulling a new version.**
```sh
bun run backup
```
The bundle is saved to `backups/` and includes both the database dump and your `.env`.
To restore: `bun run restore-backup --latest` or `--from backups/<bundle-dir>`
**Note:** If `bun run backup` fails with "Script not found", run `git pull --rebase --autostash` first without running the bot after, it only updates code files and does not touch your database, so it is safe to do before backing up.

**Manual (non-Docker) update:**
```sh
# Stop your running bot process first (Ctrl+C / service stop / pm2 stop / etc.)
git pull --rebase --autostash  # Avoids merge commits and handles dirty working trees automatically
bun install

# If you run from dist/ (bun run start), rebuild:
bun run build
```

**Docker Compose update:**
```sh
git pull --rebase --autostash  # Avoids merge commits and handles dirty working trees automatically
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

## Alternative: Docker Compose

If you prefer containerized deployment, you can use Docker Compose instead of manual setup:

**Required `.env` variables for Docker Compose:**
- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
- `CRYPTO_SECRET` - 32-character encryption key
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - Database password (other DB settings are auto-configured)

For Docker Compose, start from `.env.example`, then add `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` if you have not already set it. Optional Docker or runtime tuning values can still be copied from `.env.optional.example`.

```sh
# Build TomoriBot's container (first time or after code changes)
docker compose build

# Start TomoriBot and her database only
docker compose up
```

**Note:** Docker Compose automatically configures the database connection. The PostgreSQL service runs in development mode (no SSL) and connects to the internal Docker network.

#### Optional Docker Sidecars

TomoriBot supports optional Docker sidecars to enhance her tools and add local monitoring. All sidecars are opt-in via Docker Compose profiles:

```sh
# + SearXNG web search (self-hosted metasearch)
docker compose --profile searxng up

# + Crawl4AI browser-rendered page fetching
docker compose --profile fetch-crawl4ai up

# + Both at once
docker compose --profile searxng --profile fetch-crawl4ai up
```

See the guides below for full setup details:

- **[SearXNG Web Search Sidecar](docs/guides/setup-searxng.md)** - A self-hosted metasearch instance to bypass single-engine API limits for the `web_search` tool.
- **[Crawl4AI Sidecar](docs/guides/setup-crawl4ai.md)** - A browser-rendering sidecar to fetch and process JavaScript-heavy webpages for the `fetch_url` tool.
- **[Local Grafana Monitoring](docs/guides/local-monitoring.md)** - Instructions on how to spin up a local Grafana dashboard to monitor TomoriBot's performance and database metrics.

> **Using `bun run dev` instead of Docker Compose?** Use `bun launch --searxng --crawl4ai` — it handles the Docker container lifecycle for you automatically. See the [Optional Sidecars](#optional-sidecars-bun-launch) section above.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing


Since TomoriBot is still in Beta, any contributions made are **greatly appreciated**, especially for localization.

### To contribute a new language translation:

1. **Create a locale file** in `src/locales/` named after a [Discord locale code](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales) (e.g., `es-ES.ts` for Spanish, `fr.ts` for French, `ko.ts` for Korean)

2. **Mirror the structure** of the gold standard file [`src/locales/en-US.ts`](src/locales/en-US.ts):
   - Copy all keys and nested objects
   - Translate all user-facing text while preserving placeholders like `{variable}`

3. **Add preset translations** (optional but recommended) in `src/db/seed/02_personas.sql`:
   - Translate the `persona_preset_desc` field for each preset
   - Translate the `preset_attribute_list`, `preset_sample_dialogues_in`, and `preset_sample_dialogues_out` arrays
   - Add LLM descriptions by translating the `ja` field of each row in `src/db/seed/catalog/models.ts` (alongside the English `desc`); models are seeded into the database directly from this catalog at startup (no SQL file to regenerate)
   - Set `preset_language` to your locale code

4. **Test your translations**:
   ```sh
   # Verify all locale keys match across files
   bun run check-locales
   ```

5. **Submit a pull request** with your new locale file(s) and any `src/db/seed/*.sql` additions

### To contribute new features

The TomoriBot wiki for contributors is still WIP but there are already comprehensive documentation available at `/docs/` that can help you understand TomoriBot's architecture more. Please make sure that `bun run check`, `bun run lint`, `bun run check-locales`, and `bun run db:lifecycle` do not return any errors before doing a pull request of a new feature.
