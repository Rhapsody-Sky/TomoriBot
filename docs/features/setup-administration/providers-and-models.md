TomoriBot doesn't have a built-in AI brain — you connect one. A **provider** is an AI
service (Google Gemini, OpenRouter, NovelAI, a local endpoint, …), and a **model** is a
specific model on that provider. You need at least one provider to use her at all.

## API Keys

Add a provider key during first-time setup with `/config setup`, or later with
`/config api-key set`. Keys are **encrypted at rest** — no one, including server admins, can
read them back.

Each provider has its own key-generation steps. Run **`/help api-key`** and pick your
provider for the exact walkthrough, or use these starting points:

| Provider | Notes | Get a key |
|---|---|---|
| **Google Gemini** | Free tier, runs every feature. Recommended first setup. | [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| **OpenRouter** | One key, many models (some free). | [OpenRouter keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) |
| **NovelAI** | Subscription; uncensored storytelling/roleplay (text only). | [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) |
| **DeepSeek** | Pay-as-you-go reasoning models. | [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) |
| **NVIDIA NIM** | Hosted text, embeddings, and image. | [NVIDIA Build](https://build.nvidia.com/) |
| **Anthropic** | Claude models via the API (not Claude Code). | — |
| **Z.ai** | GLM family. ⚠️ ToS restricts usage to coding/agent scenarios. | [Z.ai](https://z.ai/) |
| **Vertex AI** | Google Cloud via `gcloud` ADC — best for locally-run/dev setups. | see below |
| **Vertex AI Express** | Google Cloud API-key BYOK (Preview, Gemini subset). | [Express Mode](https://console.cloud.google.com/expressmode) |
| **Custom** | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, vLLM, LiteLLM, …). | see [Custom Endpoints](#custom-endpoints) |

:::caution
Never share your API key with anyone else. Custom endpoints can add a Bearer auth token after setup with
`/config api-key set`.
:::

**Vertex AI** authenticates with Application Default Credentials rather than a stored secret.
For local hosting, ADC can come from `gcloud`; hosted deployments should use a workload identity
or service account. An AI Studio API key alone does not authenticate full Vertex AI. The selected
project must have billing and the Vertex AI API enabled, and the host identity needs Vertex access.
The full setup guide lives in `/help api-key provider:Google Vertex AI`.

### Optional: Brave Search key

Brave Search is separate from your AI provider and only enhances web search (adds image,
video, and news search). Set it with `/optional-key brave set`. ⚠️ Brave includes $5/month
free credit — set a $5 usage limit in the Brave dashboard to avoid charges.

## Choosing Models

After a provider is set, pick which model each capability uses:

- `/model text` — the main chat model
- `/model vision` — a vision model (for reading images when the chat model can't)
- `/model image` — image generation (see [Image Generation](/features/capabilities/media-generation/image-generation/))
- `/model video` — video generation
- `/model embedding` — embeddings for the [document knowledge base](/features/knowledge/memory/#document-knowledge-base-rag)
- `/model speech` / `/model transcription` — [voice](/features/capabilities/media-generation/tts-and-stt/)

You can also manage backup keys for automatic failover and load balancing with
`/config api-key rotation`.

## Custom Endpoints

Custom endpoints let you register self-hosted or proxy-backed services — Ollama, LM Studio,
LiteLLM, vLLM, ComfyUI, local TTS/STT — as **labeled provider bundles**.

- **Server scope:** `/provider custom-endpoint add` / `remove`.
- **Personal scope:** `/personal custom-endpoint add` / `remove` (just you — see
  [Personalization](/features/knowledge/personalization/#your-own-providers)).

A **label** groups every capability under one bundle. After registering, select the label
from `/model text`, `/model image`, `/model video`, etc.; if a label has several models for a
capability, a picker lets you choose. Re-run the add command with the same label and
capability but a different model name to register an additional model on that connection (its
URL and API style are inherited).

For full walkthroughs of running the servers, see:

- [Setup: Local LLM](/self-hosting/local-endpoints/setup-local-llm/) — Ollama, KoboldCPP, LM Studio, vLLM, LiteLLM.
- [Setup: ComfyUI](/self-hosting/local-endpoints/setup-comfyui/) — local image/video generation.
- [Setup: ChatMock](/self-hosting/local-endpoints/setup-chatmock/) — ChatGPT account / Codex CLI.

## Supported Providers

If you don't have the hardware to host your own models, TomoriBot supports a wide range of
services. Not every feature is available on every provider.
