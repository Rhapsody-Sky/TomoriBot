title: "02.6: Participants"
---

The densest single contributor: list every conversation participant with
per-user details (presence, roles, **personal memories**, reminders),
mention aliases with conflict detection, and the closing
channel/time-of-day footer.

**File:** `src/utils/text/context/participants.ts:38-236`

## Mission

For every user ID in `userList` (collected from message history by the
chat pipeline), emit a rich detail block: display name, mention aliases
(unique-resolution computed), online/presence status, server roles,
per-user personal memories (with tag-filtering against the conversation
corpus, like server memories in stage 03), pending reminders, and public
Physical Appearance tags for image generation. Then fold in Matrix bridge users and
synthetic webhook users (persona-flavored). Close with channel name +
current time-of-day (timezone-aware).

The output is *one* context item — all participants live in a single
`[System: The following users are having a conversation: ...]` block.

## Input

Substantial — see signature in `participants.ts:38-58`. Notable:

- `userList: string[]` — Discord user IDs from history
- `triggererName`, `botName`, `personaLineageId`
- `tomoriState`, `tomoriConfig` (provides `personal_memories_enabled`,
  `timezone_offset`)
- `isDMChannel`, `isUserImpersonation`, `impersonatedUserId`,
  `impersonatedIdentityName`
- `matrixUsers: Map<string, string>` — Matrix user ID → stripped display name
- `syntheticUsers: Map<string, { displayName, type: "persona" | "webhook" }>`
- `conversationCorpus` — for personal-memory tag filtering
- `snapshot`, `convertMentions`

## Output

`Promise<StructuredContextItem | null>` — `null` if `userList` is empty,
otherwise one `user`-role item tagged `KNOWLEDGE_USERS_IN_CONVERSATION`.

Also populates `conversationUsers: ConversationUserReference[]` on the
context item — a structured list used downstream for mention resolution by
the streaming pipeline.

Content shape:

```
[System: The following users are having a conversation:

If {botName} wants to ping any of these users, prepend an "@" symbol to a unique
mention handle shown below (case-insensitive). [...]

{botName} (This is you!)
- Status: Online - Currently active and responding to messages
- Physical Appearance: blue hair, red eyes, white hoodie

UserA (Mention: @{UserA}; Aliases: @{aliceA}, @{alice_global})
- Physical Appearance: short white hair, red eyes
- Status: Online - Playing Stardew Valley
- Server Roles: Mod, Member
- Memories: [id:42] Likes cats (tags: pets, animals)
- Reminders:
  - ID:42 "Take meds" (scheduled for Tue, May 21, 2026 10:00 AM (UTC-7), repeats every 24 hour(s))

Conversation context: #general (ID: 1234...).
Current time: May 21, 2026 18:30 UTC+09:00 (JST), evening.
]
```

## Side effects

- **DB / cache reads (per user)**:
  - `userRepository.loadByDiscordId(userId)` — load or `null`
  - If missing and the user is in the guild: `userRepository.register(...)`
    auto-registers them
  - `userRepository.isBlacklisted` (cached via `userCache`)
  - `userRepository.getPrivacyLevel` (cached)
  - `personalMemoryRepository.loadForUserLineage` if eligible
  - `serverScheduleRepository.getPendingRemindersForUser` for each user;
    pending reminders include `ID:N` so the LLM can target them with
    `update_task` for requester-scoped edits/deletes
- **Discord fetches**:
  - `guild.members.fetch(userId)` for role / display-name resolution
  - `client.users.fetch(userId)` fallback for users not in guild
  - `getUserPresenceDetails` for online status + activities (requires
    `GuildPresences` intent)
- **Synthetic persona enrichment** — `getCachedAllPersonas` to populate
  image-appearance tags for synthetic persona entries.
- **Mention alias collection** — addresses, server nicknames, global names,
  usernames, and custom nicknames are collected per user; `aliasCounts`
  tracks duplicates across users to detect conflicts.
- **Final mention conversion** — assembled text passes through
  `convertMentions`.

## Invariants

After this stage runs:

- Returns `null` only when `userList` is empty.
- Every user entry has a `displayName` (falls back to `<@id>` for missing
  data).
- Mention aliases marked as `unique` are exactly those that appear *once*
  across `aliasCounts` — duplicates are silently dropped from the mention
  handle list (the LLM is told "mention requires clarification" instead).
- Personal memories are filtered by privacy (`PrivacyLevel.MINIMAL`
  required) AND blacklist AND `personal_memories_enabled` AND
  conversation-corpus tag match (if `memory_tagging_enabled`).
- Physical Appearance tags are public for users/personas present in chat and
  remain separate from public attributes.
- Matrix and synthetic users are appended *after* normal users and are
  marked non-mentionable (`mentionable: false`).
- The closing footer always emits, even with one participant.

## Configuration

| Source | Field | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `tomoriConfig` | `personal_memories_enabled` | Master switch for per-user memories + nickname usage |
| `tomoriConfig` | `memory_tagging_enabled` | (Set upstream in `nativeBuilder`) Drives `conversationCorpus` tag filter for personal memories |
| `tomoriConfig` | `timezone_offset` | Hours offset for current-time footer |
| Client intent | `GuildPresences` | Required for online/activity status; without it, only static info is shown |
| User row | `personal_dtm`, `privacy_level` | Privacy controls — `FULL` users are skipped entirely from listing |
| User row | `physical_appearance_tags` | Public physical appearance image tags |

## Extension points

This is the **single richest plugin surface in the context-build pipeline**.
Multiple plugin-relevant seams:

| Surface | Plugin-relevance |
|---|---|
| Personal memories per user (`personalMemoryRepository.loadForUserLineage`) | The "personal memory type" plugin category — a sister to server memories (stage 03). |
| Matrix-user folding (`matrixUsers` map) | A bridge plugin emits its users via this map; the contributor handles them uniformly. A Telegram/Slack bridge plugin would extend the same map. |
| Synthetic users (persona / webhook) | The chat pipeline pre-populates `syntheticUsers`; a plugin shipping a new "fake participant" type would extend the map. |
| Pending reminders (`serverScheduleRepository.getPendingRemindersForUser`) | Reminder system is core, not plugin — but a plugin adding "scheduled events" might want a parallel display block here. → plugin plan candidate. |
| Physical Appearance tags (`physical_appearance_tags`) | Coupled to image-generation tooling; a plugin adding a different image-gen tag scheme would extend the `normalizeImageAppearanceTags` path. |
| Channel + time-of-day footer | Internal — coupled to `timezoneHelper`. |

**A plugin extension for "alternate participant rendering"** (e.g.
collapse-when-many-users, show-roles-only-for-mods) would either:
- (a) Wrap this contributor with a post-processor on the emitted text.
  Brittle — text format is not a contract.
- (b) Replace this contributor entirely with the plugin's own. Cleaner —
  if a "register contributor" mechanism is built. → plugin plan candidate.
