title: "02: Raw Chunk Generation"
---

Opens the provider's HTTP stream and yields a `RawStreamChunk` for each token delivery, with provider-specific pre-processing applied before each yield.

**Contract:** `BaseStreamAdapter.startStream` (generator body) — `src/types/stream/interfaces.ts:182`
**Canonical implementation:** `GoogleStreamAdapter.startStream` (stream loop) — `src/providers/google/googleStreamAdapter.ts:292-373`

## Mission

After context assembly (stage 01) prepares the request payload, the adapter calls the provider's
streaming SDK and enters a `for await` loop over the raw HTTP response. Each provider chunk is
transformed by pre-processing logic specific to that adapter before being wrapped in a
`RawStreamChunk` envelope and yielded to the stage 04 orchestrator loop.

Pre-processing at this stage is distinct from normalization (stage 03): it operates on the
raw provider-native chunk *before* type classification, and exists to handle provider-specific
streaming quirks that cannot be cleanly expressed as normalization rules.

Three pre-processing steps run in Google's adapter (other adapters have their own):

1. **Chunk normalisation into simplified shape** (`normalizeGoogleStreamChunk`) — extracts `text`,
   `functionCalls`, `promptFeedback`, `candidates`, `thoughtSignature`, and `thoughtSummary` into
   a flat structure, discarding raw SDK wrapper objects.

2. **Text + function-call split** (`splitChunkWithTextAndFunctionCalls`) — when a single SDK
   response contains both text content and a function call, the adapter emits them as two separate
   `RawStreamChunk` objects so the orchestrator can flush the pre-tool-call text before returning
   the function call result.

3. **Speaker boundary fallback guard** (`applySpeakerBoundaryFallbackGuard`) — when
   `llm_stop_speaker_pattern_enabled` is true and the SDK stop-string mechanism fails to catch a
   speaker label mid-stream, this rolling holdback buffer (32 chars) scans for the pattern and
   emits a truncated chunk + stop signal before the speaker label reaches Discord.

Each iteration yields a `RawStreamChunk`:

```ts
{
  data:     unknown;                    // provider-native chunk shape
  provider: string;                     // e.g. "google"
  metadata: { timestamp: number; model?: string; [key: string]: unknown };
}
```

After the generator exhausts normally (or the speaker guard returns early), any buffered
speaker-guard tail is flushed as a final `RawStreamChunk` before the generator returns.
Errors from the provider SDK are caught and yielded as error chunks via
`BaseStreamAdapter.createProviderErrorChunk()` rather than thrown, so the orchestrator's
error path (stage 04) handles them uniformly.

## Input

Continuation from stage 01. The HTTP streaming connection is already open. No new inputs.

## Output

Async generator of `RawStreamChunk` objects. Each chunk carries:

- `data` — provider-native streaming response object (e.g., `GoogleStreamChunk`, OpenAI SSE delta).
- `provider` — string identifying the adapter (e.g., `"google"`, `"openrouter"`).
- `metadata.timestamp` — milliseconds since epoch at yield time.
- `metadata.model` — model codename (where available from the provider's response headers/body).

The generator return value is `void`; the orchestrator drives termination by consuming the
generator until it returns.

## Side effects

- **Per yielded chunk:** `BaseStreamAdapter.onRawChunk()` is called (no-op in the base class;
  subclasses may override for logging or metrics).
- **Speaker guard:** Mutates adapter instance state (`speakerGuardPendingTail`,
  `streamedTextTail`) across chunk boundaries — these fields are reset at the start of each
  `startStream()` call so they are scoped to a single stream lifetime.
- **Error chunks:** `BaseStreamAdapter.onProviderError()` is called when an error is caught
  (no-op in base class; available for subclass override).

## Invariants

After each `yield`:

- The yielded `RawStreamChunk.data` is in the provider-specific format that `processChunk`
  (stage 03) knows how to parse — no cross-adapter chunk shapes are ever mixed.
- If the speaker guard triggered, the chunk yielded before return has `text` truncated to the
  boundary and the generator returns without further yields.
- SDK errors are always yielded as error chunks, never thrown through the generator boundary.

## Extension points

| Surface | Plugin-relevance |
|---|---|
| `BaseStreamAdapter.startStream()` generator body | **A new provider's adapter implements the full generator.** Pre-processing logic (dedup, guard, split) is adapter-local — it does not need to match other adapters' approaches. |
| `BaseStreamAdapter.onRawChunk(chunk)` | Override hook for instrumentation (e.g., logging raw chunk payloads). Internal — no behavioral contract; the orchestrator never sees override output. |
| `BaseStreamAdapter.onProviderError(error)` | Override hook for per-provider error telemetry. Internal — same caveat as `onRawChunk`. |
| Speaker boundary guard (`truncateBeforeGenericSpeakerLine`) | `src/utils/text/processors/llmOutputProcessor.ts`. Internal — coupled to TomoriBot's persona-name speaker-label convention; the `llm_stop_speaker_pattern_enabled` DB flag is the configuration surface. |
| Text deduplication (`deduplicateChunkTextAgainstRecentStream` / `getTextDelta`) | Internal — a workaround for Gemini SDK repeating the last few tokens in overlapping chunks; not a general extension seam. |

## Configuration

| Source | Key / Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TomoriState.config` | `llm_stop_speaker_pattern_enabled` | `false` | Activates the holdback-based speaker guard in the generator loop |
| `StreamAdapter` constant | `SPEAKER_GUARD_HOLDBACK_CHARS` | `32` | Characters held back at the tail before pattern matching (Google adapter) |
| `StreamAdapter` constant | `STREAM_TEXT_TAIL_CHARS` | `4096` | Rolling dedup window size in characters (Google adapter) |
| `StreamAdapter` constant | `STREAM_TEXT_MIN_DEDUP_CHARS` | `8` | Minimum chunk length before dedup logic runs (Google adapter) |
