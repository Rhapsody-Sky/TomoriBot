title: "03: Chunk Normalization"
---

Converts a provider-native `RawStreamChunk` into the uniform `ProcessedChunk` shape the orchestrator routes.

**Contract:** `BaseStreamAdapter.processChunk` — `src/types/stream/interfaces.ts:247`
**Canonical implementation:** `GoogleStreamAdapter.processChunk` — `src/providers/google/googleStreamAdapter.ts:649-760`

## Mission

Each `RawStreamChunk` yielded by stage 02 is immediately passed to `processChunk()` inside the
stage 04 orchestrator loop. This method is the boundary at which all provider-specific chunk
formats collapse into the single `ProcessedChunk` union that the orchestrator understands:

```ts
interface ProcessedChunk {
  type: "text" | "function_call" | "error" | "done";
  content?: string;           // type="text"
  functionCall?: FunctionCall; // type="function_call"
  error?: ProviderError;       // type="error"
  thoughts?: ThoughtLogEntry[]; // any type — thought log capture
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>; // terminal metadata (finish reason, thought signature)
}
```

The method also handles two additional responsibilities:

- **Error normalisation** — raw SDK errors (HTTP status codes, provider-specific error objects)
  are converted to the shared `ProviderError` shape via `handleProviderError()`. This includes
  classifying the error type (`api_error`, `rate_limit`, `content_blocked`, `timeout`,
  `provider_overloaded`) and setting `retryable` so the stage 04 orchestrator and the upstream
  key-rotation logic in `runGenerationTurn` can make retry decisions without inspecting
  provider-specific error objects.

- **Thought log extraction** — for providers that emit thought summaries or thought signatures
  (Google's `thoughtSummary` and `thoughtSignature` fields), these are extracted into
  `ThoughtLogEntry[]` on the returned chunk so the orchestrator can accumulate them into
  `state.thoughtSummarySegments` / `state.thoughtRawSegments` independently of visible text.

## Input

`chunk: RawStreamChunk` — the provider-native envelope yielded by stage 02.

## Output

`ProcessedChunk` — one of four variants:

| `type` | Carries | Orchestrator action |
|---|---|---|
| `"text"` | `content: string` | Route to stage 05 buffer flusher |
| `"function_call"` | `functionCall: FunctionCall` | Flush pending buffer → return `{ status: "function_call" }` |
| `"error"` | `error: ProviderError` | Flush pending buffer → show error embed → return `{ status: "error" }` |
| `"done"` | `metadata?: { finishReason }` | Record terminal metadata; continue loop (generator will exhaust next) |

Any variant may additionally carry `thoughts?: ThoughtLogEntry[]` when the provider emits
reasoning content in-band.

## Side effects

- None. `processChunk` is a pure transformation — it does not mutate `StreamState`, call Discord
  APIs, or trigger any timer. All side effects are owned by the orchestrator and downstream stages.

## Invariants

After this stage:

- The returned chunk's `type` is one of exactly `"text"`, `"function_call"`, `"error"`, `"done"`.
- If `type === "error"`, `chunk.error` is a fully-formed `ProviderError` with `type`, `message`,
  `retryable`, and `code` set. `originalError` preserves the raw SDK error for logging.
- If `type === "function_call"`, `chunk.functionCall` is a provider-agnostic `FunctionCall`
  `{ name, args, thoughtSignature? }`.
- Content-blocked responses (e.g., Gemini `promptFeedback.blockReason`, safety
  `finishReason`) are normalised to `type: "error"` with `error.type === "content_blocked"` and
  `retryable: false`.

## Extension points

| Surface | Plugin-relevance |
|---|---|
| `BaseStreamAdapter.processChunk()` abstract method | **A new provider adapter implements this to map its SDK chunk shapes to `ProcessedChunk`.** The contract is at `src/types/stream/interfaces.ts:184`. The implementation must be synchronous. |
| `BaseStreamAdapter.handleProviderError()` abstract method | **A new provider adapter implements this to classify its SDK errors.** The `ProviderError.retryable` flag is consumed by the key-rotation loop in `runGenerationTurn`; the `type` field drives user-facing error embed formatting. Contract at `src/types/stream/interfaces.ts:201`. |
| `BaseStreamAdapter.createErrorDescription()` abstract method | **A new provider adapter implements this to produce localized, provider-specific error text** for the error embed shown in Discord when `retryable: false` and user errors are not suppressed. Contract at `src/types/stream/interfaces.ts:207`. |
| `FunctionCall` shape (`name`, `args`, `thoughtSignature`) | The provider-agnostic function call format — `src/types/provider/interfaces.ts:145`. Fields like `thoughtSignature`, `reasoning_details`, and `deepseekReasoningContent` are provider-specific optional fields that must be preserved when passing tool results back to the provider in stage 01. |
