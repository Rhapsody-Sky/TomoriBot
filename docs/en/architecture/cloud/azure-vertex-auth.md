TomoriBot runs on an Azure VM but can call Google Vertex AI without storing a Google service
account key. Production uses Google Cloud Workload Identity Federation (WIF) and the Azure VM's
system-assigned managed identity.

## Production identity flow

1. TomoriBot reads the non-secret external-account configuration from
   `/run/secrets/google-vertex-wif.json`.
2. Google Auth obtains a managed identity token from Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS).
3. Google Security Token Service accepts that token only when its `xms_mirid` claim matches the
   production VM resource ID.
4. The federated principal impersonates the runtime service account,
   `<service-account>@<gcp-project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
5. That service account calls Vertex AI in `<gcp-project-id>`.

No Google private key or API key is stored on the VM. The checked-in
[`deploy/azure/google-vertex-wif.json`](../../../deploy/azure/google-vertex-wif.json) file contains
only public federation metadata.

## Google Cloud boundary

- Project ID: `<gcp-project-id>`, dedicated to this integration
- Project purpose: Vertex AI provider calls only; it does not host TomoriBot infrastructure
- Workload identity pool/provider: `<pool-id>/<provider-id>`
- Runtime service account roles: Vertex AI User and Service Usage Consumer
- Service account binding: Workload Identity User for principals admitted by the pool
- Provider condition: exact Azure production VM resource ID (`xms_mirid`)

The Azure VM must retain its system-assigned identity. Terraform declares this in
`terraform/azure/vm.tf` so a future apply does not remove it.

## Deployment

The Azure deployment workflow installs the federation file at
`/etc/tomoribot/google-vertex-wif.json` with owner `root`, group ID `1001`, and mode `0640`.
Docker Compose mounts it read-only and sets `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the container
path. Treat write access to the host copy as privileged even though the file is not a secret:
changing its audience or impersonation target changes the identity TomoriBot requests.

## Discord configuration

Run `/provider add`, choose **Google Vertex AI**, and enter your own project and location in
`<gcp-project-id>::<location>` form, for example:

```text
my-vertex-project::global
```

The saved value is the Google project and location, not a credential. The Azure workload identity
provides the credential at runtime. **Google Vertex AI Express** is a separate API-key provider and
does not use this path.

## Verification

After deployment, verify that the container is healthy, the credential file is mounted read-only,
and a small Vertex request succeeds. TomoriBot's provider setup uses `models.list` with a one-item
page as its authentication smoke test. This exercises ADC, federation, service-account
impersonation, project/location configuration, and the Vertex endpoint without generating a
model response or depending on a particular model ID.

Billing budgets and alerts are monitoring controls, not hard spending caps. Keep this project free
of unrelated resources so its billing activity is attributable to Vertex usage.
