TomoriBot can be configured for **you specifically** with the `/personal` commands — settings
that follow you across every server you share with her, independent of any server's
configuration.

## Personal Memories

Facts she remembers about you follow you between servers. Managing them (add, remove, export)
is covered on the [Memory](/features/knowledge/memory/#personal-vs-server-memories) page.

## Your Own Providers

Personal providers let *your own requests* use *your own* API keys and models instead of the
server's defaults. This is bring-your-own-key (BYOK) at the individual level.

Two scopes are in play, and it's worth keeping them straight:

- **Server default**: shared configuration for one server, managed through `/provider` and
  `/model` by members with the required server permission. It applies to everyone there.
- **Personal override**: configuration used only for your own requests. When enabled it
  overrides the server default for that capability **across every server** where you use
  TomoriBot, not just the one you set it up in.

**Setup:**

1. `/personal provider add` saves a provider (your key is encrypted). This also enables your
   personal **Text** override immediately, using that provider's default text model.
2. `/personal provider model-text` is optional. Use it only if you want a different text model
   than the default chosen in step 1. Picking a model here keeps Text enabled.
3. `/personal provider toggle-models` enables or disables overrides per capability (Text,
   Embedding, Image, Video, Vision).

Step 3 is not required after every model selection. Selecting a model with any
`/personal provider model-*` command already activates that capability; the toggle command is
how you turn one back **off** and hand the capability back to each server's default.

Turning a capability off remembers which provider was serving it, so switching it back on
returns to that same provider rather than to whichever one you happen to have saved first.

Because steps 1 and 2 switch you onto a cross-server override, TomoriBot asks you to confirm
before saving whenever a capability moves from the server default to a personal one. Rotating
the key on a provider that already answers your requests skips that confirmation, since the
routing isn't changing.

Thought logs attribute those turns to you, and you can tune them with `/personal parameters`
and `/personal model fallback`. Both affect your requests everywhere and never touch this
server's settings. You can also register personal custom endpoints with
`/personal custom-endpoint add`; see
[Custom Endpoints](/features/setup-administration/providers-and-models/#custom-endpoints).

If a request fails while using your personal provider, the error's "What you can do" tips name
the personal commands that can actually fix it (`/personal provider model-text`,
`/personal model fallback`, `/personal parameters`) rather than the server-manager ones. Turning
**Text** off in `/personal provider toggle-models` usually hands the turn back to the server
model, unless that server runs User BYOK mode, which requires a personal provider.

:::note[BYOK-required servers]
A server can require member-provided providers with User BYOK mode
([Server Moderation](/features/setup-administration/server-moderation/#user-byok-bring-your-own-key)). When that's
on, your user-triggered messages need a personal provider before she can answer. Personal
providers apply across every server you use her in.

## Other Personal Settings

- `/personal nickname` — change what she calls you.
- `/personal image-tags` — your own appearance tags (booru-style), used when an
  [image generation](/features/capabilities/media-generation/image-generation/#tag-customization)
  references you. Submit an empty box to clear them.
- `/personal privacy` — control your visibility to her, up to **full invisibility** (opt out
  of memory features entirely).
- `/personal dtm` — your personal override for
  [Deliberate Trigger Mode](/features/chatting-personality/chatting-and-triggers/#deliberate-trigger-mode).
- `/personal stm` — opt into cross-server short-term memory sharing;
  `/personal stm clear` wipes your STM.
- `/personal impersonate prompt` — set a reusable prompt for when she impersonates you via
  `/bot impersonate`.
  
## Personal Spotlight

**Personal Spotlight: per-channel persona picks.** Spotlight lets *you* narrow which personas
you can trigger in one channel — and optionally assign one to auto-trigger for your own
messages there. It's scoped to **you + one channel** and doesn't affect anyone else.

**Set one up** with `/personal spotlight set`, choosing:

- a duration in hours (use **0** to keep it until you remove it manually),
- the target channel,
- the personas you want in your spotlight.

After choosing personas, you can optionally pick one as your **personal auto-trigger
persona** — the fallback responder for your messages in that channel. Direct triggers still
target whichever persona you explicitly call. Press Finish to skip.

**Important rules:**

- Spotlight only **narrows** access; it never expands it. The selected personas are the
  *only* ones you can trigger there.
- It still respects server-level limits like `/server whitelist persona`.
- Proxy chains are blocked: if your spotlight only includes Alice, an Alice reply can't hand
  off to Bob for your message chain.

Review or remove entries with `/personal spotlight manage` (uncheck to remove; timed
spotlights expire on their own). Run `/help spotlight` for the Discord summary.
