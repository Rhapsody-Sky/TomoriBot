If you host TomoriBot on an Azure VM, you can ship the bot's structured error logs into an
Azure Log Analytics workspace and build Grafana error panels on top of them. This page covers
the whole pipeline: the bot-side JSONL file output, the Azure Monitor Agent ingestion, and the
operational rules that keep ingestion reliable and cheap.

For monitoring a local instance with Grafana instead, see
[Local Grafana Monitoring](/self-hosting/local-monitoring/).

## Pipeline overview

```text
Pino structured logs (level >= 50 in production)
  -> /app/logs/tomoribot.jsonl in the container   (TOMORI_LOG_FILE)
  -> /var/log/tomoribot/tomoribot.jsonl on the VM (bind mount)
  -> Azure Monitor Agent "Custom Text Logs" data source
  -> Data collection rule (DCR) parses each RawData line with parse_json()
  -> Log Analytics custom table (e.g. TomoriBotLogs_CL)
  -> Grafana error panels
```

The DCR uses **Custom Text Logs**, not Custom JSON Logs. The file is UTF-8 JSONL, but
production error records contain nested `err` and `context` objects; collecting each line as a
single `RawData` string and parsing it inside the DCR transform is the reliable
Azure-supported route for nested JSON.

## Step 1: Enable the JSONL file output

Set `TOMORI_LOG_FILE` to a writable path inside the container:

```sh
TOMORI_LOG_FILE=/app/logs/tomoribot.jsonl
```

Behavior:

- Only active in JSON output mode (production, or any run without the `pino-pretty` dev
  transport). Development pretty-printing is unchanged and ignores the variable.
- Every emitted record is written to **both** stdout (so `docker logs` diagnostics keep
  working) and the file, as identical newline-delimited JSON, via an append-only synchronous
  stream.
- Production logs at level `error` (50) and above, which includes the custom levels
  `metric` (52) and `rateLimit` (55). An empty file on a healthy instance is normal.

### Container wiring

`deploy/azure/docker-compose.yml` sets the variable and bind-mounts the host directory over
the image's `/app/logs`:

```yaml
environment:
  TOMORI_LOG_FILE: /app/logs/tomoribot.jsonl
volumes:
  - /var/log/tomoribot:/app/logs
```

The container runs as the non-root user `tomori` (UID/GID 1001), so the host directory must
be owned by that ID. The Azure deploy workflow creates it before Compose starts:

```sh
sudo install -d -o 1001 -g 1001 -m 0750 /var/log/tomoribot
```

### Verifying the host file

After a deploy, on the VM:

```sh
sudo ls -la /var/log/tomoribot
sudo tail -n 3 /var/log/tomoribot/tomoribot.jsonl
```

Every nonempty line must be one valid JSON object. The file may legitimately be empty until
the first production error occurs.

## Step 2: Create the custom table

Create a custom table (this guide uses `TomoriBotLogs_CL`; the `_CL` suffix is required) in
your Log Analytics workspace with the Log Analytics Tables REST API
(`2021-12-01-preview`), using this schema:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TimeGenerated` | DateTime | Original Pino event time, with ingestion time as fallback |
| `Computer` | String | Populated by Azure Monitor Agent |
| `FilePath` | String | Populated by Azure Monitor Agent |
| `level` | Int | Pino numeric level |
| `msg` | String | Pino log message |
| `code` | String | Top-level or nested error code |
| `errorType` | String | Error type/name (`type` is a reserved column name and is rejected) |
| `commandName` | String | Command context when available |
| `message` | String | Error message with `msg` fallback |
| `RawData` | String | Original JSON line for access-controlled troubleshooting |

Wait until the table appears in the workspace before creating the DCR.

## Step 3: Create and associate the DCR

Custom text log collection requires a **data collection endpoint** (DCE) in the same region;
create one first and reference it from the DCR. Then create the DCR (platform **Linux**),
associate it with the VM (installing Azure Monitor Agent if needed), and add a
**Custom Text Logs** data source:

- File pattern: `/var/log/tomoribot/tomoribot.jsonl`
- Table: `TomoriBotLogs_CL`
- Record delimiter: end-of-line (correct for JSONL)
- Destination: Azure Monitor Logs -> your workspace

Apply this ingestion-time transformation. Its projected columns must exactly match the table
schema. The trailing `where` clauses drop known-noisy records (periodic cache metrics and
provider availability retries) to control ingestion cost:

```kusto
source
| extend p = parse_json(RawData)
| extend EventTime = datetime(1970-01-01) + tolong(p["time"]) * 1ms
| extend TimeGenerated = iff(isnull(EventTime), TimeGenerated, EventTime)
| extend level = toint(p.level)
| extend msg = tostring(p.msg)
| extend code = iff(isempty(tostring(p.code)), tostring(p.err.code), tostring(p.code))
| extend errorType = iff(isempty(tostring(p.type)), tostring(p.err.name), tostring(p.type))
| extend message = iff(isempty(tostring(p.message)), iff(isempty(tostring(p.err.message)), tostring(p.msg), tostring(p.err.message)), tostring(p.message))
| extend commandName = iff(isempty(tostring(p.commandName)), tostring(p.context.commandName), tostring(p.commandName))
| where level >= 50
| where msg != "metric:cache_sizes"
| where RawData !contains "UNAVAILABLE"
| where RawData !contains "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED"
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, FilePath, level, msg, code, errorType, message, commandName, RawData
```

DCR transformations compile against a restricted KQL subset, which shapes the query above:
`coalesce()` and `unixtime_milliseconds_todatetime()` are not available (hence the nested
`iff(isempty(...))` fallbacks and the epoch arithmetic), and `time` is a reserved keyword in
the transform parser, so the Pino timestamp field must be accessed as `p["time"]`.

### Terraform ownership of VM attachments

The existing workspace, DCE, DCR definitions, and custom tables remain external to Terraform, but
the production VM's `AzureMonitorLinuxAgent` extension and its VM Insights/application-log DCR
associations are Terraform-managed. Their complete, non-sensitive existing resource IDs are set in
`terraform/azure/terraform.ci.tfvars` and must be updated if either DCR is deliberately replaced.

This boundary is intentional: replacing the VM deletes its extensions and associations, while the
workspace and DCRs survive. The next Terraform apply therefore restores collection without
rewriting the existing streams, table schemas, or ingestion transforms. Do not re-create the
workspace or DCR definitions merely because a replacement VM has no incoming data.

## Step 4: Test ingestion end to end

Append a harmless synthetic level-50 record to the host file (do not manufacture a real bot
failure), wait roughly 5-10 minutes for initial ingestion, then query the workspace:

```kusto
TomoriBotLogs_CL
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30m)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

If nothing arrives, check: DCR-to-VM association, Azure Monitor Agent status on the VM, exact
file path and directory permissions, that each line is valid one-line UTF-8 JSON, DCR error
metrics, and that the transform's projected columns match the table schema exactly.

## Step 5: Cache-size metrics (second dataflow)

The logger emits a periodic `cache_sizes` sample (custom level 52, one line every
`CACHE_METRICS_INTERVAL_MS`, default 5 min) carrying every in-memory cache count plus process
RSS. The error dataflow above deliberately drops these (`msg != "metric:cache_sizes"`) so the
error table stays clean. To chart them, the same DCR carries a **second dataflow** that reads
the same file stream but keeps only cache samples and projects their numeric fields into a
dedicated table, `TomoriBotCacheMetrics_CL` (typed `int`/`real` columns for each cache plus
`rss_mb`/`rss_pct`). Two dataflows over one input stream is the supported pattern; their
`where` filters are disjoint, so no record is double-counted.

Second dataflow transform (abridged — one `toint(p.<field>)` per cache column):

```kusto
source
| where RawData contains "metric:cache_sizes"
| extend p = parse_json(RawData)
| extend TimeGenerated = datetime(1970-01-01) + tolong(p["time"]) * 1ms
| extend rss_mb = toreal(p.rss_mb), rss_pct = toreal(p.rss_pct)
| extend shortTermMemory = toint(p.shortTermMemory), tomoriState = toint(p.tomoriState) // ...
| extend discord_users = toint(p.discord_users), discord_members = toint(p.discord_members) // ...
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, rss_mb, rss_pct, /* app caches */, /* discord.js caches */
```

Cost note: this reverses the original "drop cache_sizes to save ingestion" decision, but the
volume is tiny — ~288 samples/day at ~900 bytes (~260 KB/day), well within the free tier. The
discord.js caches (`discord_users`, `discord_members`, `discord_channels`, `discord_presences`)
are the real memory story; the app caches are usually small.

## Grafana

Point panels at an Azure Monitor data source whose identity has `Reader` on the resource group
and `Log Analytics Reader` on the workspace. That identity needs **read access only** —
ingestion permissions belong to the DCR/agent path, never to Grafana. Current panels:

- **Error count** (`Time series`) — `TomoriBotLogs_CL` counted per minute. `make-series`
  returns packed arrays, so append
  `| mv-expand TimeGenerated to typeof(datetime), Errors to typeof(long)` or the series will
  not render.
- **Error log** (`Logs`) — `TomoriBotLogs_CL` showing `TimeGenerated`, a title from
  `code`/`errorType` + `message`, `commandName`, and `RawData`.
- **Cache sizes** (`Time series`, stacked) — `TomoriBotCacheMetrics_CL`, one series per cache
  column, for spotting growth/leaks.
- **Token consumption** (`Time series`, stacked bars) — Postgres `stat_counters`,
  `SUM(count)` of `tokens_in`+`tokens_out` grouped by `bucket` (day) and `metric_key` (model).
  Daily grain only; the table stores no finer bucket.

The token panel uses Grafana's separate read-only PostgreSQL login over TLS `verify-full`; it must
not use the application runtime or administrator credential. Keep the Azure Monitor VM/error/cache
panels alongside the direct PostgreSQL statistics panels. The retired
`Custom-TomoriBotTokenMetrics_CL` DCR flow must not be recreated: PostgreSQL remains authoritative
for token, cost, and usage statistics.

Beware GCP-carryover panel state: legend-click "hide series" overrides and series-name color
rules reference the *old* query's series names and silently misfire on Azure queries (e.g. a
`byNames: ["tomoribot"]` exclude override blanks an Azure series named `value`).

## Operational rules

- **`RawData` is privileged troubleshooting data.** Access is limited to identities with Log
  Analytics read access, currently the designated operator/Grafana identity. It can contain error
  context after structured redaction, so do not publish it in GitHub Actions output or widen
  workspace roles. Retain it while nested context is needed; reconsider removing it only after
  parsed columns have proven sufficient.
- **Retention is 30 days.** Keep the workspace at the production 30-day retention baseline unless
  an explicit incident-response or cost decision changes it.

- **Keep the file append-only.** Do not add log rotation that renames files into a pattern
  the DCR's file glob still matches — Azure Monitor Agent treats a renamed file as new
  content and duplicates ingestion. Design retention so rotated files fall outside the
  collected pattern, and only after the pipeline is verified.
- **Cost control lives in the DCR transform.** Prefer adding `where` clauses there over
  widening what the bot writes; everything that passes the transform is billed ingestion.
- **stdout is unaffected.** `docker logs` keeps working regardless of `TOMORI_LOG_FILE`, so
  the file can be wiped or the variable removed without losing container diagnostics.
