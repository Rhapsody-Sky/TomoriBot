title: "02: Admission Check"
---

The gatekeeper. Decides if/how a message becomes a generation turn.

**File:** `src/utils/chat/admission.ts:66-267`

## Mission

Decide whether this message turns into a generation pass and, if so, eagerly
load the early state (persona list, main `TomoriState`) downstream stages need
to start one. Returns a discriminated `ChatAdmission` — runnable or one of four
non-runnable dispositions.

## Input

`ChatIncoming` (from stage 01).

## Output

`ChatAdmission` — discriminated union (`src/utils/chat/types.ts:93-126`):

- **`RunnableChatAdmission { disposition: "run", ...gathered state }`** —
  proceed to stage 04. Eagerly populated fields:
  - `serverDiscId`, `userDiscId`, `cooldownUserDiscId`
  - `isDMChannel`, `guild`
  - `tomoriState`, `allPersonas` (main persona + sibling personas)
- **`NonRunnableChatAdmission { disposition, reason, error? }`** — terminate
  at stage 03. Disposition variants:
  - `"ignore"` — bot/webhook/self-reply suppression, easter eggs, audio failure
  - `"queued"` — channel busy; the queue policy in `admissionQueue` decided
    enqueue rather than reject
  - `"blocked"` — privacy, permissions, rate limit, unsupported channel,
    bot-reply-block, full-privacy user
  - `"error"` — unexpected failure (rare)

## Side effects

- **Voice transcription** — if the message has audio attachments, transcribes
  them and either posts a transcript-as-webhook (chat mode) or caches the
  transcript text (legacy mode); message content is mutated in-place via
  `applyEffectiveMessageContent` to inject the transcript inline so downstream
  stages see the spoken text.
- **Self-reply chain bookkeeping** — `updateSelfReplyChainState` and
  `setSelfReplyChainOriginUser` updated based on message authorship and
  manual-trigger flag.
- **`$whoami` easter egg** — sends an info embed to the channel and returns
  `ignore` when content === `"$whoami"`.
- **Audio transcription failure embed** — sends a user-visible warn embed when
  STT fails with an attributable reason, the message has no text content, and
  the turn is allowed to surface user errors. Passive guild messages stay
  quiet.
- **Suppression cleanup** — clears `selfReplySuppressionUntil` entries that
  have expired.
- **Text-quota state cleanup** — `cleanupTextQuotaTriggerStates()` prunes stale
  entries.
- **Persona-job mutation** — if the message is a likely-self message and not
  manually triggered, sets `incoming.isPersonaJob = true` so downstream stages
  can distinguish persona-driven self-replies from user messages.

## Invariants

After this stage runs:

- If `disposition === "run"`, `tomoriState` and `allPersonas` are non-undefined.
- Privacy-level `FULL` users are blocked unconditionally (except for
  self-reminders and manual triggers).
- DM channels never carry a guild; guild text/thread/voice channels always do.
- An audio transcript that succeeded leaves a `voice_transcript` cache entry
  keyed by message ID (legacy mode) or a posted webhook message (chat mode),
  not both.

## Extension points

This stage is **a long sequence of fixed checks**, not a polymorphic seam.
Extensibility lives in the helpers it calls:

| Helper | File | What it does | Plugin-relevance |
|---|---|---|---|
| `isMatrixRelayMessage`, `isRealUserLikeMessage` | `triggerProcessor.ts` | Trigger-source classification | A new bridge plugin would extend trigger detection here |
| `transcribeMessageAudioAttachment` | `audioAttachmentTranscription.ts` | STT dispatch | STT providers register via `customEndpointService` — existing mechanism, not chat-specific |
| `evaluateAdmissionQueueAndTriggerGate` | `admissionQueue.ts` | Channel-busy + trigger gate decision tree; includes cross-persona trigger guard that bypasses the follow-up path when the incoming message explicitly targets a different persona than the active one | → plugin plan candidate if plugins want to add admission policies |
| `getSelfReplyChainOriginUser`, `updateSelfReplyChainState` | `selfReplyState.ts` | Self-reply chain memory | Internal — tightly coupled to cascade-trigger limit semantics |

**The stage itself is internal** — there is no current seam for "replace
`evaluateChatAdmission`." A future plugin-extension for early admission veto
would likely take the form of a pre-admission hook (`beforeAdmission(incoming)
→ Disposition | null`) running before the fixed checks, not a wholesale
override.
