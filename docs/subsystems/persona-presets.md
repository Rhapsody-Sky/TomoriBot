title: "Persona Presets"
---

Official persona presets are seeded from the typed catalog in `src/db/seed/catalog/personas.ts` into `persona_presets`. They are the canonical definitions for bundled characters such as Tomori/Rose, Temari, Aphel, Lilya, and Nerine.

This page covers how official preset text/config content is applied and kept current through the copy-on-write pointer model. Avatar media is applied as a one-time Discord/storage operation and is called out separately below.

## Data Model

### `persona_presets`

Official preset rows carry a stable `preset_lineage_id`.

- Reuse the same `preset_lineage_id` across locale variants of the same character.
- Do not change a character's `preset_lineage_id` just because text, triggers, sample dialogue, or avatar art changed.
- New official characters need a new stable `preset_lineage_id`.

`preset_lineage_id` is related to, but not the same operational concern as `personas.persona_lineage_id`:

- `preset_lineage_id` identifies the official preset family (which character a preset is).
- `persona_lineage_id` scopes memory/conditioning identity.
- Applying a preset usually stamps the preset lineage onto the persona's `persona_lineage_id`, so personas derived from the same official character share memory scope.
- Legacy bootstrapping does not rewrite an existing `persona_lineage_id`, because that would move memory scope.
- Import with fork identity can intentionally allocate a fresh `persona_lineage_id` while still pointing at the same official preset.

### `personas` preset pointer columns

Personas can point at live official preset rows instead of storing an independent copy:

- `is_pointer` marks a persona as a live preset pointer.
- `preset_lineage_id` and `preset_language` identify the `persona_presets` row to resolve.
- `persona_lineage_id` remains the memory/conditioning identity and is preserved when the pointer materializes.

When `is_pointer = true`, runtime reads resolve the persona's preset-backed content from `persona_presets`:

- attributes and public flags
- sample dialogues
- trigger words
- persona prompt

The persona row and normalized child rows still carry copied values for compatibility with older surfaces, but live preset data is authoritative while the persona is a pointer.

Trigger words are the one preset-resolved field that is further post-processed: because every preset bundles the shared base word (`tomori`), `loadAllForServer` collapses contested words to a single owner after resolving them (main persona wins base words; alters keep only what no higher-priority persona already claimed). See `docs/subsystems/multi-persona.md` → *Single-owner trigger resolution*. The de-duped result, not the raw preset list, is what routes messages.

Avatars are the exception to live pointer resolution. `persona_presets.preset_avatar_path` is an application source asset, not a runtime-resolved pointer field. Main persona avatars live as the bot's Discord guild member avatar, while alter avatars live in `personas.webhook_avatar_url` as an avatar-storage URL/path. Because those are external Discord/storage media references, later seed changes to `preset_avatar_path` do not fan out to existing pointer personas.

### `persona_presets.preset_attribute_public_flags`

A `BOOLEAN[]` aligned 1:1 with `preset_attribute_list`. Pointer personas resolve these flags from the live preset row; materialized copies store them in `persona_attributes.is_public`. Official Tomori presets mark their first appearance-style attribute public; public attributes can be shown to other personas triggered by the same message. All other seeded attributes are private.

The flags are still derived at seed time, not authored in each catalog row. `seedPersonasFromCatalog()` runs the preserved `official_attribute_flags` update after the persona upsert for lineage IDs `4`, `716`, `1770`, `3585`, and `50`.

## Applying Presets

Applying an official preset creates a **copy-on-write pointer** when the preset has a `preset_lineage_id`. The persona follows the live `persona_presets` row until the first local content edit materializes it into an independent copy.

### `/config setup`

Setup creates the main persona as a pointer to the selected official preset, stamps `persona_lineage_id` from the preset lineage, and applies the preset avatar to the bot's Discord guild avatar when running in a guild.

### `/persona default`

For the main/default target, `/persona default` re-points the main persona to the selected official preset and patches the bot's Discord guild avatar. Re-running it after customization discards local preset-backed content by establishing a fresh pointer.

For `type=alter`, `/persona default` creates an alter pointer from the preset, uploads a copy of the preset avatar through avatar storage, and stores the resulting reference in `personas.webhook_avatar_url`.

Preset-application avatar writes are one-time operational Discord/storage updates and do not materialize a pointer: `/config setup`, `/persona default`, and `/persona import` can establish or preserve the pointer while applying the preset avatar. Direct `/server avatar` edits are different; setting or resetting a persona avatar is deliberate customization and materializes a pointer before the avatar write.

## Materialization

The first local content edit forks a pointer into an independent copy. Materialization preserves `persona_id` and `persona_lineage_id`, copies the current live preset content into `personas`, `persona_attributes`, and `persona_configs`, then sets `is_pointer = false`.

This fork is binary per persona, not field-level: after any content edit, future seed updates no longer change that persona's preset-backed content. Re-running `/persona default` is the supported way to opt back into the live official preset.

Memory and runtime-state writes do not materialize pointers. Server memories, personal memories, conditioning history, autochat runtime counters, cooldowns, and similar runtime rows continue to use `persona_lineage_id`/`persona_id` normally.

## Import/export cards

Native Tomori preset exports include `attribute_public_flags`, aligned 1:1 with `attribute_list`. Older Tomori preset files that do not have this field remain valid; import normalizes them to all-private flags before writing `persona_attributes`.

Exports materialize pointer personas into self-contained preset files by reading the current live preset content. When the source persona is or was derived from an official preset, export stamps `preset_lineage_id` in the native Tomori preset payload.

Import re-links to an official preset pointer only when all of these are true:

- The file has `preset_lineage_id`.
- A seeded `persona_presets` row with that lineage exists.
- Attributes, public flags, sample dialogues, trigger words, and persona prompt exactly match that official preset.
- The file does not carry persona-specific NovelAI/custom fields that are not part of official presets.

If any exact-match check fails, import creates an independent copy with `is_pointer = false`. The imported `preset_lineage_id` is kept as provenance when present, but `preset_language` remains null.

`/persona generate` emits the canonical six generated attributes and marks only the generated Appearance attribute public. `/persona create` emits an explicit all-private flag array because its single freeform description is not guaranteed to be an appearance-only field. SillyTavern card conversion also defaults converted attributes to private because ST cards do not carry Tomori public visibility metadata.

### Import Now button

The `/persona generate` and `/persona create` success messages are rendered as Discord [Components V2](https://discord.com/developers/docs/components/reference) containers (`buildPersonaResultContainer` in `src/utils/discord/ui/interactionCore.ts`) rather than classic embeds: the generated PNG is surfaced through a single-item `MediaGallery`, the old embed color maps to the container `accentColor`, and an action button can live inside the same card.

`/persona generate` also renders its processing state and post-processing error states as Components V2. This keeps the original interaction reply in one message mode for its full lifecycle; Discord rejects edits that combine `MessageFlags.IsComponentsV2` with legacy `embeds` or `content`, and an earlier processing embed can otherwise make the final V2 success edit fail. When an error response preserves `preset_generation_input.txt`, the file is referenced through a Components V2 `File` component.

In guild contexts that card carries a manager-only **Import Now** button. Because the success message is public, the restriction is enforced on click (`ManageGuild`), not by visibility. Pressing it imports the freshly generated persona **as an alter** — it never replaces the existing main persona — using the same `importAlterPreset` core (`src/utils/persona/importAlterPreset.ts`) that backs `/persona import type=alter`. The in-memory preset and PNG buffer are reused, so no re-upload or re-download occurs. Wiring lives in `src/utils/persona/importNowButton.ts`.

The button is one-shot (a successful import disables it and relabels it "Imported"; a failure re-arms it) and driven by a per-message collector — DMs never receive it because alter import is guild-only. Collector lifetime is capped below Discord's 15-minute interaction-token window so the timeout teardown can still edit the original reply, and is configurable via `PERSONA_IMPORT_NOW_BUTTON_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 14 minutes).

## Editing Official Presets

Editing seeded text/config fields in `src/db/seed/catalog/personas.ts` changes live pointer personas and future applications after the next startup seed. Editing `preset_avatar_path` only affects future preset applications; existing pointer personas keep their current Discord guild avatar or stored `webhook_avatar_url`. Independent copies do not change. Startup invalidates cached Tomori state for servers that have pointer personas after schema/catalog-seed/migration work, so long-lived cache entries do not keep stale preset content after seed updates.

System prompt presets are authored separately in `src/db/seed/catalog/systemPrompts.ts` and seeded by `seedSystemPromptsFromCatalog()` immediately after persona presets.

## Migration behavior

The previous seed-time 3-way rebase sync design has been removed. It used a per-persona baseline and attempted to merge official updates into local copies, but it was fragile and never shipped to production.

Migration `020_persona_preset_pointers.sql` adds the pointer columns and converts only exact matches into pointers. The backfill requires matching lineage, attributes/public flags, sample dialogues, trigger words, and persona prompt. It intentionally does not compare or rewrite avatars, so existing Discord/CDN/storage avatar state stays as-is. Customized personas stay independent copies.

If a pointer references a missing official preset row, materialization fails closed by logging an error and refusing the fork. Runtime reads are more resilient: they log a warning and fall back to the persona's last copied snapshot instead of failing the whole state load.
