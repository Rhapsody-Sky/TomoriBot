title: "Adding a Persona Preset"

This guide covers how to add a new official persona preset to TomoriBot's seed data.

## Steps

1. Create a new folder under `src/db/seed/catalog/personas/<name>/` and add one locale file per language variant (e.g. `en-US.ts`, `ja.ts`). Export a single named `persona` constant of type `PersonaInput` from each file, then import and register it in `src/db/seed/catalog/personas/index.ts`. Required fields:
   - `preset_lineage_id` — a stable identity anchor for this character. Reuse the same lineage ID
     across locale variants of the same character so they are treated as one canonical identity,
     and so applying the preset can stamp a consistent `persona_lineage_id` (memory scope) onto
     the persona.
   - `name`, `desc`, `attributes`, paired `sampleDialoguesIn` / `sampleDialoguesOut`,
     `language`, `avatarPath`, and `triggerWords`.
   - `preset_attribute_public_flags` is not authored in the row. The bundled official
     lineages derive it in the preserved `official_attribute_flags` update inside
     `src/db/seed/catalog/personaSeed.ts`: the first attribute is public and the rest
     are private. Pointer personas resolve these from the live preset row, and materialized
     copies store them in `persona_attributes.is_public`.

2. Place an avatar image (PNG recommended) inside the persona folder (e.g. `src/db/seed/catalog/personas/<name>/avatar.png`). Set `avatarPath` in the locale file to the folder path without a filename — the runtime auto-discovers the first image alphabetically, so the filename does not need to match any preset name. Preset application applies the avatar once to the guild (main persona) or uploads it to storage (alter) through `/config setup`, `/persona default`, and preset import without forking the pointer. Runtime pointer reads do not sync avatars from `preset_avatar_path`: existing personas keep their Discord guild avatar or stored `webhook_avatar_url` until the preset is applied again. Later `/server avatar` edits are treated as deliberate customization and materialize the persona before changing or resetting its avatar.

3. Add or edit reusable system prompt presets in `src/db/seed/catalog/systemPrompts.ts`.
   System prompts are split from personas but seed immediately after persona presets at startup.

4. Run `bun run check-models` to validate all seed catalogs offline. It checks persona name
   uniqueness, paired sample-dialogue arrays, required official attributes, non-empty system
   prompt text, and NovelAI default uniqueness.

5. Validate via `/config setup`, `/persona default`, `/persona export`, and `/persona import`.
   Pointer personas should resolve the seeded values, reflect later seed edits after cache
   invalidation, and materialize on the first local content edit.

## Applying vs. Syncing

Applying an official preset is a **copy-on-write pointer** when the preset has
`preset_lineage_id`: setup/`/persona default` store `personas.is_pointer = true` plus
`preset_lineage_id`/`preset_language`, and runtime reads resolve preset-backed text/config content
from the live `persona_presets` row.

Avatars are not part of that live sync. `preset_avatar_path` is a source image for application time:
main personas are patched into Discord guild-member avatar state, while alter personas store an
uploaded avatar reference in `webhook_avatar_url`. Changing the seed avatar affects future
applications, not already-applied pointer personas.

The first local content edit materializes that persona into an independent copy while preserving
`persona_id` and `persona_lineage_id`. Memory/runtime writes do not materialize. Re-running
`/persona default` re-establishes the pointer and discards local preset-backed changes.

Native exports of pointer personas are self-contained copies that stamp `preset_lineage_id`.
Import re-links to an official pointer only when the exported content exactly matches a seeded
preset with the same lineage; customized files import as independent copies.

## Quality Gate

```bash
bun run check-models # seed catalog invariants
bun run check        # TypeScript strict mode
bun run lint         # Biome formatting
```

Then run a local seed against a dev database and verify the preset appears correctly under `/persona`.
