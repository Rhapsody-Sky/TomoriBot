/**
 * Shared text-cleaning for tool-authored replies.
 *
 * Built-in tools that send Discord text on Tomori's behalf (e.g. the reply action of
 * `interact_with_recent_message`) bypass the streaming segment pipeline, where
 * `cleanLLMOutput` + guild mention resolution normally run. Without this helper, emoji
 * shortcodes (`:name:` / malformed `<:name:>`) and `@handle` mentions reach Discord as raw
 * text instead of resolved tags. This helper applies the *same* transform chain the stream
 * path uses (`segmentProcessor.sendBufferSegment`) so tool replies and normal replies render
 * identically — making it the single source of truth for both code paths.
