You may also use the ready-to-use [ComfyUI workflows](https://github.com/Bredrumb/TomoriBot/tree/main/assets/comfyui-workflows) from the GitHub repository instead.`,
      comfyui_page1_workflow_field: `1. Build The Workflow`,
      comfyui_page1_workflow_value: `Create and test the workflow in ComfyUI first. For images, the MVP should end in \`SaveImage\` so TomoriBot can download the finished file. A minimal image graph is usually: \`CheckpointLoaderSimple\` -> positive/negative \`CLIPTextEncode\` -> \`EmptyLatentImage\` -> \`KSampler\` -> \`VAEDecode\` -> \`SaveImage\`.`,
      comfyui_page1_placeholders_field: `2. Add Placeholders`,
      comfyui_page1_placeholders_value: `Use \`{TOMORI_PROMPT}\` directly in text fields. TomoriBot replaces supported \`{TOMORI_*}\` tokens inside the uploaded API-format JSON before queueing it. String placeholders can be embedded in longer text. Numeric and boolean placeholders should usually be the entire exported JSON value.`,
      comfyui_page1_export_field: `3. Export And Edit The JSON`,
      comfyui_page1_export_value: `When the workflow works in ComfyUI, use Save (API Format). If you need numeric or boolean placeholders, edit the exported JSON before uploading and use them as the full value, for example \`"width": "{TOMORI_WIDTH}"\`, \`"height": "{TOMORI_HEIGHT}"\`, or \`"duration": "{TOMORI_VIDEO_DURATION}"\`.`,

      comfyui_page2_numeric_field: `Image Dimensions`,
      comfyui_page2_numeric_value: `Dimension placeholders: \`{TOMORI_WIDTH}\` and \`{TOMORI_HEIGHT}\`. For image generation TomoriBot derives these from the requested aspect ratio. Use them where your JSON expects numbers, such as latent size or canvas size fields.`,
      comfyui_page2_video_field: `Video Arguments`,
      comfyui_page2_video_value: `Video placeholders: \`{TOMORI_VIDEO_DURATION}\`, \`{TOMORI_DURATION_SECONDS}\`, \`{TOMORI_VIDEO_RESOLUTION}\`, \`{TOMORI_RESOLUTION}\`, and \`{TOMORI_GENERATE_AUDIO}\`. These resolve from the \`generate_video\` tool args before the workflow is queued.`,

      comfyui_page3_image_refs_field: `How References Are Gathered`,
      comfyui_page3_image_refs_value: `For \`generate_image\`, \`media_id\` contributes all images from the referenced Discord message and \`target_identity\` can add one or more user or persona avatars as extra references. For \`generate_video\`, \`media_id\` contributes the first image from that message as the starting frame.`,
      comfyui_page3_reference_tokens_field: `Reference Placeholders`,
      comfyui_page3_reference_tokens_value: `TomoriBot exposes \`{TOMORI_REFERENCE_IMAGE_COUNT}\`, \`{TOMORI_REFERENCE_IMAGES}\`, \`{TOMORI_REFERENCE_IMAGES_JSON}\`, and indexed values such as \`{TOMORI_REFERENCE_IMAGE_1_DATA_URL}\`, \`{TOMORI_REFERENCE_IMAGE_1_BASE64}\`, \`{TOMORI_REFERENCE_IMAGE_1_MIME_TYPE}\`, and \`{TOMORI_REFERENCE_IMAGE_1_URL}\` when a source URL exists. The same indexed pattern continues for \`_2_\`, \`_3_\`, and so on.`,
      comfyui_page3_reference_note_field: `Important Caveat`,
      comfyui_page3_reference_note_value: `TomoriBot can transport reference-image data into the workflow JSON, but stock ComfyUI nodes do not automatically turn those strings into an \`IMAGE\` tensor. Reference placeholders are mainly useful with a custom node or node pack that can decode data URLs, base64 payloads, or JSON arrays.`,

      comfyui_page4_video_field: `Video Flow`,
      comfyui_page4_video_value: `When you run a video workflow, TomoriBot resolves the workflow placeholders, POSTs the saved graph to ComfyUI's \`/prompt\` API, polls \`/history/{prompt_id}\`, then downloads the first saved file from \`/view\`. ComfyUI endpoints with auth now receive the saved bearer token on those API calls too.`,
      comfyui_page4_output_field: `Saved Outputs`,
      comfyui_page4_output_value: `TomoriBot still downloads only the first saved output, so the workflow must produce a real saved image or video file. Preview-only nodes are not enough. If the workflow saves multiple outputs, TomoriBot will return the first one ComfyUI reports in history.`,
      comfyui_page4_metadata_field: `extra_pnginfo Metadata`,
      comfyui_page4_metadata_value: `TomoriBot also sends resolved values in \`extra_pnginfo\`, including prompt, model, mode, aspect ratio, width, height, size, reference-image count, and video-specific duration/resolution/audio fields. That is useful if you prefer a custom ComfyUI node that reads execution metadata instead of JSON placeholders.`,
      comfyui_summary_description: `ComfyUI custom endpoints let TomoriBot queue your saved image or video workflow and return the first saved output. The full setup guide covers workflow export, placeholders, reference images, polling, and output rules.`,

- Imported does not always mean sent: nodes disabled in \`prompt_order\` stay off until you enable them with {stPresetToggle}
- Comment-only nodes and nodes that become empty after \`{{trim}}\` are never sent
- If enabled nodes still contain unsupported preset macros after import, the import summary warns you; those tags may still be sent literally or behave differently here
- Unknown markers are skipped
- Order is literal: if you place \`chatHistory\` before \`dialogueExamples\`, live chat comes first
- I use the \`prompt_order\` in the .json with \`character_id: 100001\`, and falls back to \`100000\` only if \`100001\` is missing
- If sample chats end up last, the bot adds a short separator so strict providers do not continue the example`,
      embed2_footer: `If something looks missing, compare the imported node list in {stPresetToggle} against your preset JSON`,
      embed3_title: `Limits And Compatibility (Page 2)`,
      embed3_description: `- Post-history / depth injections are merged into existing chat history entries, not inserted as standalone messages
- Multiple nodes at the same depth are batched together
- \`{{setvar}}\` and \`{{addvar}}\` work across enabled nodes in node order, but variables are global for the whole preset
- Most native blocks are moved, not removed: \`main\`, \`charDescription\`, \`charPersonality\`, \`dialogueExamples\`, \`chatHistory\`, and \`worldInfo\` markers reposition my own system prompt, persona prompt, persona attributes, sample chats, live history, and retrieved docs
- The real suppressions are narrow: the built-in fallback system prompt is removed only if you did not set {configSystemPromptSet}, and native \`charDescription\` / \`charPersonality\` are skipped only when a custom node already expands \`{{description}}\` / \`{{personality}}\`
- Tomori-only automatic blocks are not owned by ST markers: server info, memories, emoji/sticker context flush after \`main\` / \`charDescription\` / \`charPersonality\`; users-in-conversation, STM, conditioning, and leftover RAG flush before \`dialogueExamples\` / \`chatHistory\`
- User impersonation via {botImpersonate} ignores the preset and uses the normal layout
- Older text-completions presets that use \`context.story_string\` + \`sysprompt.content\` are imported through a best-effort conversion path
- That legacy conversion maps the main system prompt, story layout, and post-history, but ST-only blocks like \`persona\`, \`scenario\`, anchors, stop strings, and old backend settings are still ignored
- Some extra legacy \`post_history\` fields on modern Prompt Manager presets are imported too
- Regex post-processing, preset-side temperature/top_p/model overrides, and layered presets are not supported
- \`worldInfo\` markers use retrieved document context instead of ST lorebooks
- Some automatic server/context blocks may still be inserted even if your preset does not place explicit ST markers for them
- Provider-specific behavior still applies: assistant prefill may work on some providers and be ignored on others`,

      parameters_title: `Tuning Behavior ({stmParameters})`,
      parameters_description: `Adjust the core knobs (*"crude"* means the original, unsummarized messages: the raw conversation before I condense it into a summary):
- **Refresh cadence**: how many of my turns pass between refresh nudges (default **5**).
- **Render mode**: how the summary and the raw messages combine. *Supersede* (the summary replaces the raw messages) or *Crude + summary* (show both).
- **Crude messages**: how many recent raw (unsummarized) messages to keep in context (default **6**).
- **Nudge depth**: where the refresh nudge sits in the conversation (0 = very bottom; 2 = just above the latest exchange, the default).
- **Content depth**: where my memory block sits (-1 = up top as background knowledge, the default; 0 = very bottom; N = before the Nth turn from the bottom). At the same depth as the nudge, my memory block sits just above it.`,

**Example:**
\`\`\`
{user}: Hey, how are you?
{bot}: Yoooo {user}! I'm doin' great, ya feel me?
\`\`\`

**Tips for Great Sample Dialogues:**
- Write natural, conversational exchanges
- Include personality traits you want me to exhibit
- Demonstrate the tone you want
- Add variety to help me learn better
- Use placeholders so dialogues work for everyone when sharing me with \`/persona export\``,

If an MCP server requires no authentication, leave the **Auth Token** field blank. Some servers may use a different auth format — check the server's documentation for details.

Your auth token is encrypted at rest and never shown in plain text after saving.`,
