/**
 * Stat-tracking metric catalog.
 *
 * Each value is one `metric` in the `stat_counters` table. Adding a new metric
 * is a new entry here — never an `ALTER TABLE` (the long/narrow counter table
 * carries the metric and its sub-key as data, not columns). See
 * plans/stat-tracking.md §5 for the full catalog and grain notes.
 *
 * `metric_key` semantics per metric:
 *   - command_used  → full command path, space-joined (e.g. "config humanizer",
 *                     "server welcome-channel set"); not just the top-level category
 *   - model_used    → model id / codename
 *   - tokens_in     → model id / codename (count accumulates input token deltas, not 1)
 *   - tokens_out    → model id / codename (count accumulates output token deltas, not 1)
 *   - tool_used     → tool name
 *   - sprite_shown      → sprite name (every delivered sprite, identity or not)
 *   - sprite_emotion    → sprite name, recorded ONLY for non-identity sprites so the
 *                         sprite's user-given tag can feed the emotion breakdown
 *                         (getEmotionBreakdown) without dragging in DID-alter identity
 *                         sprites. sprite_shown stays the all-inclusive leaderboard count.
 *   - emoji_used        → emoji name
 *   - sticker_used      → sticker name/id
 *   - active_hour       → hour-of-day "0".."23"
 *   - text_generated    → "" (one per completed chat turn)
 *   - user_impersonation_triggered → impersonated Discord user id (one per
 *                                    completed user-impersonation chat turn)
 *   - image_generated   → model codename (one per successful image generation; keyed
 *                         so the total is SUM(count) over keys while still exposing a
 *                         per-model breakdown that cannot be backfilled later)
 *   - video_generated   → model codename (one per successful video generation)
 *   - audio_generated   → TTS backend label ("elevenlabs" | "tts-clone" |
 *                         "tts-voice-design"); one per successful voice message.
 *                         Backend (not raw voice id) is used: low-cardinality,
 *                         privacy-safe, and answers "paid API vs local TTS" for cost.
 *   - (all others)      → "" (scalar event counter)
